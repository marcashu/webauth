		<h3> Self-Review:</h3>

		<p>Along with using techniques that come with JavaScript I also had to use many different techniques in order to create these web pages that make up this website such as using jQuery which was optional but I decided to learn how to carry out particular tasks using it inside of JavaScript for example in giving the website the ability to use local storage on one of the pages which is shown in the above image. I also learned the simple techniques that come with HTML Mark-up such as knowing how to use particular tags and do’s and don’ts of using the tags especially those that come with HTML5 and sometimes when looking online I found help with certain aspects but I couldn’t use the suggestions on how to do a certain thing as they were no long available on HTML5 or bad practice which was another thing that came with learning these techniques.</p>

		<h3>Interoperability:</h3>

		<p>One thing that was made sure of is that my website was interoperable, meaning that it would work on all of the popular browsers, I tested my website on Google Chrome, Opera, Firefox, Microsoft edge and Internet Explorer, all of the tests came back with the same result that the website works the same on all of them. Interoperability also considers the ability for a webpage to work on different devices which is also true from my website as I had tested my website on a wide variety of different devices including the following, iPad Pro, iPad, iPad Mini, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, Samsung Galaxy S5, Samsung Galaxy Note II, Blackberry Z30, Blackberry Playbook, Laptop and Desktop screens, I even tried it out on a 42” TV, this shows that my website is fully interoperable as it works on a broad range of devices along with a range of popular web browsers.</p>

		<h3>HTML 4 vs. HTML 5:</h3>

		<p>One of the differences between HTML 4 and HTML 5 is the syntax, it has been simplified and made easier to use and understand, for example the tags there are many tags which have changed add and even some removed in order to make functions easier to use and create new function too, for example the a tag which previously was used as an anchor as well as for hyperlinking it is now only used for hyperlinking. Another example of the differences between HTML4 and HTML5 is that in HTML4 the syntax was actually less strict as you didn’t necessarily need to close all tags, which is actually a good thing initially but eventually you come to the realisation that you need to close tags due to compatibility issues with other browsers.<p>

		<p>Another difference between the two is that it has been made much easier to gain access of the user’s geographical location as in HTML 4 it was very difficult but the new implementation of the Geolocation using JavaScript makes it so much easier in HMTL5.</p>

		<p>A big improvement which came with HTML5 is the support of integration of multimedia elements into webpages which allow developers to add videos and audios into their pages whereas on HTML4 there would be a plugin from a third party required which would have to be installed by the user an example would be something such as flash.</p>

		<h3>Web Standards:</h3>

		<p>Web standards are the rules and guidelines which a web developer is required to follow when developing a web page, earlier I discussed the differences between some of the standards in HTML4 and HTML5. These web standards are to be followed when creating and designing a website in order for consistency in the design of code in order for there to be a systematic way in which a website is presented to a user.</p>

		<p>Some of the advantageous elements of these standards are that the web pages can be accessed from a variety of different browsers and devices which is known as interoperability. Another great advantage that comes with having a fully validated website is that it makes it easier to maintain your website which is due to the standards need for clean code.</p>

		<h3>Validation:</h3>
 
 
		<p>As you can see there are no errors however there are warnings such as having no heading however a heading would not be needed in the section, I could have perhaps used a div tag but would that have been better or worse? I personally thought my syntax would be neater having separate section tags containing div tags as this was a recommendation so although I knew of the warning when going through validation I still went ahead with it.</p>

		<p>Now for the warning about the viewports, I was required to use these as I could not get a lot of my pages to work in the way I wanted for other devices other than computers and laptops using just Media Queries so I looked online for alternatives and this was one that worked for me.</p>
